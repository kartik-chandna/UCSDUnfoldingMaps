# UCSDUnfoldingMapsProject

This repository contains my solutions to assignments for UCSD's course [Object Oriented Programming in Java](//coursera.org/learn/object-oriented-java/home/) on Coursera.

The final project for this course is visualising earthquakes data on an interactive map. The earthquake information is obtained in real time. The project uses the Unfolding library (http://unfoldingmaps.org/).
